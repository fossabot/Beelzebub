# Beelzebub

---

### Building

Currently, Beelzebub requires the following to be built:  

 1. GNU Make
 2. mkisofs
 3. GCC
 4. binutils

*Make* is required for the whole process.  
*mkisofs* is required for construction an ISO file. You can skip this if you really want, but should you?  
*GCC* is the only compiler supported right now, mainly because of the advanced inline assembly syntax. Also, **AMD64 code and ELF64 are required**.  
*binutils* are required (used indirectly through GCC) for binary linkage.  

Preferably, a [cross-compiler](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) would be used, but one targetted for AMD64 Linuces should work just as well.  
The compiler paths are hardcoded into the makefiles, for now. Sorry.  

Besides these, Visual Studio (2013+ I think) solution and project files are supplied as a nice wrapper.

Also, your output file of interest is `/build/beelzebub.amd64.x86.iso`.

#### Makefiles

Every component of Beelzebub has its own makefile, as does the whole project.  
To build Beelzebub, simply run `make amd64`.  

Yes, a target architecture must be specified to every makefile and AMD64 is the only supported architecture right now.  

The `install` target moves the output of the component makefiles to the main *build* directory.  

**The makefiles fully support partial builds**. Well, except when changing headers in Jegudiel. But it works perfectly with Beelzebub.  

#### Visual Studio solution and projects

These have been created for convenience, mainly. They fully support partial builds, complete (re)builds and cleanup.  

**However, Cygwin is required** to run the GCC toolchain.  
You require an environment variable named `CYGWIN_BIN` that points to your Cygwin installation's */bin* directory, e.g. `C:\cygwin64\bin`.  
Make sure you restart Visual Studio if you added/changed this variable while it was running, otherwise it won't update.  

The solution, projects and dependency settings are organized in such a way that the projects are built in the right order and you get all the output files where they belong.  
Sadly, it doesn't support debugging or running a VM/emulator, at least yet.
