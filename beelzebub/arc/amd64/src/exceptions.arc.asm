extern GetExceptionContext

global EnterExceptionContext

;   Performs the transition into an exception context.
;   Arguments:
;       RDI: Address of context to enter;
;   When re-entered through the swap or resume pointers, those two should remain
;   valid!
EnterExceptionContext:
    push    rbp
    mov     rbp, rsp
    ;   Base pointer... For correctness.

    mov     byte [rdi + 104], 0
    ;   Marks the context as not ready.

    mov     eax, 0
    mov     [rdi + 88], rax
    ;   Sets the payload to null.

    mov     [rdi + 48], r15
    mov     [rdi + 40], r14
    mov     [rdi + 32], r13
    mov     [rdi + 24], r12
    mov     [rdi + 16], rbp
    mov     [rdi +  8], rcx
    mov     [rdi     ], rbx
    ;   These are callee-saved registers.

    mov     [rdi + 56], rsp
    mov     rdx, .resume
    mov     [rdi + 64], rdx
    mov     rax, .swap
    mov     [rdi + 72], rax
    ;   Stores the current stack pointer, the resume pointer and the swap pointer.

    mov     rdx, [rsp]
    mov     [rdi + 80], rdx
    ;   This preserves the return address.

    call GetExceptionContext
    ;   Now RAX will hold the pointer to the current exception context's address.

    mov     rdx       , [rax]
    mov     [rdi + 96], rdx
    ;   This sets the entering context's previous pointer to the current context

    mov     byte [rdi + 104], 1
    ;   Marks the context as ready.
    
    mov     [rax     ], rdi
    ;   And this sets the current exception context pointer to the address of
    ;   the entering context.

    mov     eax, 1
    ;   This is the return value for the standard call of this function.

    pop     rbp
    ret

.swap:
    mov     rsp, [rdi + 56]
    mov     r15, [rdi + 48]
    mov     r14, [rdi + 40]
    mov     r13, [rdi + 32]
    mov     r12, [rdi + 24]
    mov     rbp, [rdi + 16]
    mov     rcx, [rdi +  8]
    mov     rbx, [rdi     ]
    ;   This restores stack pointer and all calee-saved registers.

    ;   Swapping ends with resuming.
    ;   When resumed by an exception handler, normally it's going to be the one
    ;   restoring registers and such.

.resume:

    ;   Now that the context is resuming, it must be deactivated so it doesn't
    ;   re-enter accidentally.

    mov     byte [rdi + 104], 0
    ;   Marks the context as not ready.

    mov     rax, [rdi + 80]
    mov     [rsp], rax
    ;   This restores the return address.

    ;   The previous exception context is not restored as the current context
    ;   yet. This is so new exceptions can be thrown and link this context's
    ;   exception as the previous/cause.

    mov     eax, 0
    ;   This is the return value for resuming...

    pop     rbp
    ret
